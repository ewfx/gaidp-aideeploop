​The Python project utilizes Streamlit, LangChain, and Pandas to automate the creation of data profiling rules, thereby enhancing data governance and anomaly detection. By integrating Generative AI, the application streamlines data management processes through AI-driven rule generation and intelligent transaction flagging.​

Key Components:

User Interface with Streamlit:

Facilitates user-friendly interactions, allowing users to upload regulatory documents (PDFs) and datasets (CSV files).​

Generative AI Integration via LangChain:

Employs LangChain to interface with language models for generating data profiling rules based on regulatory documents.​

Enhances anomaly detection by leveraging AI capabilities.​

Workflow:

Document and Data Upload:

Users upload a regulatory document and a dataset through the Streamlit interface.​

Text Extraction and Rule Generation:

The application extracts text from the uploaded PDF.​

Utilizes LangChain to generate data profiling rules from the extracted text.​
Streamlit

Anomaly Detection:

Applies the generated rules to the dataset to identify anomalies.​

Results Display:

Presents the generated rules and detected anomalies to the user within the Streamlit app.​
