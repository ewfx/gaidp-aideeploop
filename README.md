Additional Configuration Tips

Handling LLM Models:
For the LLM components, you'll need to either:
Use a local model (like downloading from HuggingFace)
Connect to an API (like OpenAI)

Environment Variables:
Store sensitive information like API keys in environment variables
Create a .env file in your project root:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


Sample Test Data

Create a sample PDF (or use an existing regulatory document) and place it in your project folder to test the parser component.
For testing the rule generator, you can create a sample CSV file or use the DataFrame example provided in the main.py file.
